# 🔄 Basic_Change_Tracks

Welcome to the **Basic_Change_Tracks** repository — a centralized collection for tracking incremental changes, file updates, and version-controlled practices across different projects and components.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Maintain and monitor file-level changes and refinements.
- Document and track update histories in an organized manner.
- Serve as a reference hub for basic versioning strategies applied across multiple use cases and repositories.

## 🧩 Structure

Each subfolder within this repository will contain an individual module or functional example demonstrating specific update tracking, change logs, or improvement practices. These submodules are named and documented clearly for ease of access and future reference.

### 📂 Example Sub-Repositories
- `Schedule_Track` – A web-based daily activity schedule tracker with CSV export support.
- `VersionedConfigs` – (Planned) Folder to track config evolution across systems.

## ✅ Goals

- Encourage transparent change management.
- Promote modular and traceable development practices.
- Showcase adaptable techniques for various file tracking needs.
