# 🔄 Basic_Change_Tracks

Welcome to the **Basic_Change_Tracks** repository — a centralized collection for tracking incremental changes, file updates, and version-controlled practices across different projects and components.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Maintain and monitor file-level changes and refinements.
- Document and track update histories in an organized manner.
- Serve as a reference hub for basic versioning strategies applied across multiple use cases and repositories.

## 🧩 Structure

Each subfolder within this repository will contain an individual module or functional example demonstrating specific update tracking, change logs, or improvement practices. These submodules are named and documented clearly for ease of access and future reference.

### 📂 Example Sub-Repositories
- `Schedule_Track` – A web-based daily activity schedule tracker with CSV export support.
- `VersionedConfigs` – (Planned) Folder to track config evolution across systems.

## ✅ Goals

- Encourage transparent change management.
- Promote modular and traceable development practices.
- Showcase adaptable techniques for various file tracking needs.

## 🚀 **7-Day C++ Crash Course Plan (for C Programmers)**

---

### 📅 **Day 1: C++ Basics & Syntax Differences from C**

#### ✅ Concepts to Learn:

* Input/output (`cin`, `cout`)
* Namespaces (`std`)
* Function overloading
* Default arguments
* References (`&`)
* Inline functions

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Write a function with default arguments.
* Convert a C `printf/scanf` program to use `cin/cout`.
* Write a function overloaded for `int` and `double`.

---

### 📅 **Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming Basics**

#### ✅ Concepts to Learn:

* Classes and objects
* Access specifiers (`public`, `private`)
* Constructors and destructors
* `this` pointer

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Create a `Car` class with attributes and methods.
* Implement a constructor that initializes car data.
* Create an array of car objects.

---

### 📅 **Day 3: Inheritance & Polymorphism**

#### ✅ Concepts to Learn:

* Inheritance types (`public`, `protected`)
* Method overriding
* Virtual functions
* Abstract classes and pure virtual functions

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Create a base class `Shape` and derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
* Override a virtual function `area()`.
* Create a pointer to `Shape` that calls `area()` polymorphically.

---

### 📅 **Day 4: Templates & Exception Handling**

#### ✅ Concepts to Learn:

* Function and class templates
* Try-catch blocks
* Standard exceptions (`std::exception`, `runtime_error`, etc.)

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Write a function template for swapping two values.
* Create a class template `Box<T>` to store a value.
* Throw and catch an exception for invalid input.

---

### 📅 **Day 5: Standard Template Library (STL)**

#### ✅ Concepts to Learn:

* `vector`, `map`, `set`, `pair`
* Iterators
* `sort()`, `find()`, and other algorithms

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Store and sort student marks using `vector<pair<string, int>>`.
* Count word frequency using `map<string, int>`.
* Practice 5 STL-based problems on HackerRank or LeetCode.

---

### 📅 **Day 6: Modern C++ Features (C++11 – C++20)**

#### ✅ Concepts to Learn:

* `auto`, `nullptr`, `range-based for`
* Lambda functions
* Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
* Move semantics and `std::move`

#### 🛠️ Tasks:

* Use `auto` and range-based loop to iterate over a `vector`.
* Replace raw pointers with `unique_ptr`.
* Write a lambda to filter even numbers from a `vector`.

---

### 📅 **Day 7: Mini Project Day + Review**

#### ✅ Concepts to Apply:

* OOP
* STL
* Templates
* Smart pointers

#### 🛠️ Project Suggestions (Pick One):

1. **Student Management System** (Add, delete, search students using `map`)
2. **Banking System** (Using OOP and STL to manage accounts)
3. **Library Inventory** (Class templates, `vector`, smart pointers)

#### 🔁 Review:

* Revisit weak areas
* Take a short C++ quiz (available on sites like GeeksForGeeks, HackerRank)
